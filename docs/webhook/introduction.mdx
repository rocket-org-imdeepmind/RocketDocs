# Introduction

Webhooks are automated messages sent from one application to another when an event occurs. They provide real-time data updates and trigger actions in other systems. In Rocket, webhooks can be configured for every type of API.

When you configure a webhook in a Rocket API, Rocket automatically makes a `POST` call to the configured webhook every time the API is called and successfully resolved.

Rocket also passes a variety of information with the webhook call as the body parameter. Below is the information that Rocket sends in the webhook call.

```js
const body = {
  body: request.body,
  params: request.params,
  query: request.query,
  resp: payload,
};
```

- `request.body`: Represents the body of the original request.
- `request.params`: Represents the path parameters of the original request.
- `request.query`: Represents the query parameters of the original request.
- `payload`: Represents the response from the API.

By configuring webhooks, you can ensure that your systems stay in sync and trigger necessary actions automatically when specific events occur in Rocket.
