# Understanding Attributes

Attributes are one of the most important concepts to understand in Rocket. Like SQL tables, attributes define the structure of tables and the operations needed for the attribute. For example, when you mark an attribute as searchable, Rocket automatically creates a search API.

Attributes support various configurations. Below, you can see all the possible configurations. The configurations are grouped into sections similar to how they are organized in Rocket's UI, making them easy to follow.

## Basic Details

### Name

Each attribute needs a unique name. This name can be used to create the API URL. Make sure to provide a simple name that follows Rocket's [entity](/misc#entity-names) name rules.

### Description

Each attribute needs a description. This description is used for documenting the API.

## Data Type

### Data Type

Every attribute needs to be one of the data types supported by Rocket. Based on the data type, only certain types of data can be added and only certain operations are allowed.

The following are the data types supported by Rocket:

| Data Type  | Description                                                                                                                                  | Constraints                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Number     | Number data type supports both integer and floating point numbers.                                                                           | -                                          |
| Boolean    | Boolean values, representing "true" and "false."                                                                                             | -                                          |
| String     | Simple text strings, with length constraints for validation.                                                                                 | Min Length: 0, Max Length: 255             |
| Large-Text | For extensive textual content, with length restrictions for validation.                                                                      | Min Length: 0, Max Length: 4096            |
| Array      | Arrays enable the storage of multiple items within a single attribute. Array items can be of any data type. Arrays can have mixed data type. | Min Array Length: 0, Max Array Length: 100 |
| Enum       | A specialized data type that allows variables to hold predefined constants. Only string values are supported in Enum.                        | -                                          |
| Date       | Date data type offers support for storing date values.                                                                                       | -                                          |
| Date-Time  | Date-Time type supports both date and time values.                                                                                           | -                                          |

When the Data Type is Enum, an additional field called Enum Values also needs to be filled, which defines the possible values for the Enum.

### Optional

When a field is marked as optional, it accepts null values. Certain operations are disabled when attributes are marked as optional. Check the documentation for each attribute operation to understand the impact.

## Indexing

### Unique

Marking an attribute as unique ensures that only distinct values are accepted, preventing duplication. Certain operations change their behavior when an attribute is marked as unique.

### Index

When an attribute is marked as indexable, Rocket automatically creates an API to retrieve data based on the attribute.

For example, if the `id` attribute is marked as indexable within a table, then Rocket generates an API endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}`. This API will return data where `id` is `{attributeValue}`. If the attribute is also marked as unique, then this API will return just a single element.

## Query Operations

### Searchable Attributes

When an attribute is marked as searchable, Rocket will create an API for searching.

For instance, selecting the "name" attribute as searchable results in an API endpoint of the format `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/search/name?query={attributeValue}`. This API will search records based on the attribute `name`. The search operation is case-insensitive and checks for any substring match.

- [ ] It change other supported operations
- [ ] It is optional
- [x] The result from this API is paginated

:::

:::info[Supported DataType]

- String

:::

:::note

For other data types, like Date or Number, partial matching cannot work. So to filter results for these data types, use the `equal` or `oneOf` operation.

:::

### Sortable Attributes

When attributes are marked as sortable, Rocket will add an optional sorting query parameter in all `GET` APIs.

For example, if there is already an index API for the attribute `id` and the `name` attribute is marked as sortable, then Rocket will create endpoints as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?sortByName={asc|desc}`. The API will have an optional query parameter `sortByName`. The default value for it is `asc`.

:::

### Less Than

When an attribute is marked as `lessThan`, an optional query parameter is added to all `GET` APIs. When a value for this parameter is provided, Rocket adds a filter that returns results where the value of the attribute is less than the provided value.

For example, if there is already an index API for the attribute `id` and the `age` attribute is marked as `lessThan`, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?lessThanAge={attributeValue}`. The API will have an optional query parameter `lessThanAge`.

:::

### Less Than Equal

When an attribute is marked as `lessThanEqual`, an optional query parameter is added to all `GET` APIs. When a value for this parameter is provided, Rocket adds a filter that returns results where the value of the attribute is less than or equals the provided value.

For example, if there is already an index API for the attribute `id` and the `age` attribute is marked as `lessThanEqual`, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?lessThanEqualAge={attributeValue}`. The API will have an optional query parameter `lessThanEqualAge`.

:::

### Greater Than

When an attribute is marked as `greaterThan`, an optional query parameter is added to all `GET` APIs. When a value for this parameter is provided, Rocket adds a filter that returns results where the value of the attribute is greater than the provided value.

For example, if there is already an index API for the attribute `id` and the `age` attribute is marked as `greaterThan`, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?greaterThanAge={attributeValue}`. The API will have an optional query parameter `greaterThanAge`.

### Greater Than Equal

When an attribute is marked as `greaterThanEqual`, an optional query parameter is added to all `GET` APIs. When a value for this parameter is provided, Rocket adds a filter that returns results where the value of the attribute is greater than or equals the provided value.

For example, if there is already an index API for the attribute `id` and the `age` attribute is marked as `greaterThanEqual`, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?greaterThanEqualAge={attributeValue}`. The API will have an optional query parameter `greaterThanEqualAge`.

### One Of

When an attribute is marked as `oneOf`, an optional query parameter is added to all `GET` APIs. When a value for this parameter is provided, Rocket adds a filter that returns results where the value of the attribute is one of the provided value.

For example, if there is already an index API for the attribute `id` and the `gender` attribute is marked as `oneOf`, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?oneOfGender={attributeValue1}&oneOfGender={attributeValue2}`. The API will have an optional query parameter `equalAge` that accept an array of numbers.

## Write Operations

### Editable Attributes

When marked as editable, Rocket will create API to update data where this attribute value will be used to find the desired records.

For example, if `name` attribute is marked as editable, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `PUT /{databaseId}/{tableId}/{attributeName}/{attributeValue}`.
