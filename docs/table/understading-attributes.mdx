# Understanding Attributes

Attributes are one of the most important concept to understand in Rocket. Similar to SQL tables, attributes also define the structure of table, but additionally it also defines operations needed on the attribute. For example, when you mark an attribute as searchable, Rocket automatically creates a search API.

Attributes support variety of configurations, see below to understand all possible configurations. The entire configuration is grouped into multiple sections similar to how it is grouped in the Rocket's UI so it is easy to follow.

## Basic Details

### Name

Each attribute need to have an unique name. The name can be used for making the API url. Provide a simple name that follows Rocket's [entity](/misc#entity-names) name rules.

### Description

Each attribute need to have a description. The description is used for documenting the API.

## Data Type

### Data Type

Every attribute needed to be one of data types supported by Rocket. Based on the data type, only certain types of data can be added and only certain operations are allowed.

Following are the supported data types supported by Rocket:

| Data Type  | Description                                                                                                           | Constraints                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Number     | Number data type supports both integer and floating point numbers.                                                    | -                                          |
| Boolean    | Boolean values, representing "true" and "false,"                                                                      | -                                          |
| String     | Simple text strings, with length constraints for validation.                                                          | Min Length: 0, Max Length: 255             |
| Large-Text | For extensive textual content, with length restrictions for validation.                                               | Min Length: 0, Max Length: 4096            |
| Array      | Arrays enable the storage of multiple items within a single attribute. Array items can be of any data type.           | Min Array Length: 0, Max Array Length: 100 |
| Enum       | A specialized data type that allows variables to hold predefined constants. Only string values are supported in Enum. | -                                          |
| Date       | Date data type offers support for storing date values.                                                                | -                                          |
| Date-Time  | Date-Time type support both date and time values.                                                                     | -                                          |

When DataType is Enum, an additional field called Enum Values also needed to be filled which defines the possible values for the Enum.

### Optional

When a field is marked as optional, it accept null values. Certain operations are disabled when attributes are marked as optional. Check documentation for each attribute operations to understand the impact.

## Indexing

### Unique

Marking an attribute as unique ensures that only distinct values are accepted, preventing duplication. Certain operations changes their behavior when marking as unique.

### Index

Designating an attribute as indexable empowers Rocket to automatically generate APIs for data retrieval based on that attribute. In cases where the attribute isn't unique, multiple data rows may be retrieved.

For example, if "id" serves as an indexable attribute within a table, Rocket generates an API endpoint as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}`.

## Query Operations

### Searchable Attributes

When attributes are marked as searchable, Rocket will create APIs for data searches using the specified attribute.

For instance, selecting the "name" attribute results in an API endpoint of the format `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/search/name?query={attributeValue}`, allowing for targeted data searches.

### Sortable Attributes

When attributes identified as sortable, Rocket will add an optional sorting query parameter in all `GET` APIs.

For example, if `name` attribute is marked as sortable, then rocket will create endpoints as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?sortByName={asc|desc}`.

### Less Than

When LessThan flag is enabled for an attribute, an optional query parameter is added that to all `GET` APIs.

For example, if for `age` attribute, lessThan operation is enabled, then rocket will create an endpoints as `/{databaseId}/{tableId}/id/{attributeValue}?lessThanAge={attributeValue}`.

## Write Operations

### Editable Attributes

When marked as editable, Rocket will create API to update data where this attribute value will be used to find the desired records.

For example, if `name` attribute is marked as editable, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `PUT /{databaseId}/{tableId}/{attributeName}/{attributeValue}`.

### Deletable Attributes

When marked as deletable, this attribute is used as a key to delete data.

For example, if `id` attribute is marked as deletable, then Rocket will create an endpoint as `DELETE /{databaseId}/{tableId}/{attributeName}/{attributeValue}`.
