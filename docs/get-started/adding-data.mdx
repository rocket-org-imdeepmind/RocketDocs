# Adding Data

After defining your table, you can begin populating it with data. Simply follow the structure of the table and add data that matches that structure. Here's how you can add new data to your table:

## Step 1: Select the Table

1. **Navigate to the Data Page**: Log in to your Rocket account and access the dashboard.

2. **Choose Your Database**: Select the appropriate database from the top right database selector.

3. **Access the Data Page**: Click on the "Data" link in the left navigation to enter the data management section.

4. **Select the Table**: From the list of available tables, click on the table where you want to add new data. This will open the data entry page for that specific table.

## Step 2: Add Data

5. **Click the "+" Button**: In the table, you'll find a "+" button. Click on it to start adding new data.

6. **Enter Data**: Enter the data for each field based on the structure of the table. Follow the same data types and attributes you defined when creating the table.

7. **Type Data**: Type in the values for each attribute, ensuring they match the data types and constraints you set for the table.

8. **Save Data**: After entering the data, click the "Save" button to store the new information in the table.

## Step 3: Review and Manage Data

9. **Confirmation**: You'll receive a confirmation message once the data is saved successfully.

10. **Edit Data**: If you need to make changes to existing data, you can do so by selecting the data entry and clicking the "Edit" button.

11. **Delete Data**: To remove data, select the data entry and click the "Delete" button. Be cautious, as this action is irreversible.
