# Creating Tables

Within Rocket, each database consists of multiple tables. These tables define the structure of your data and the specific operations that can be performed on the data.

## Creating a New Table

To create a new table in your Rocket database, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Database**: Log in to your Rocket account and select the desired database from the database selector on the top right corner.

2. **Access Tables**: Click on the "Tables" link in the left navigation to proceed.

3. **Create Table**: Click the "+" button to begin creating a new table.

4. **Table Details**:

   - **Table Name**: Give your table a meaningful and descriptive name that represents the type of data it will store (e.g., 'Users,' 'Posts').

   - **Description**: Add a brief description to provide context for the table's purpose and usage.

5. **Save Table**: Once you've configured all the details, click the "Create" button to create your new table.

6. **Table Attributes**: After creating the table, you can start adding individual attributes. For each attribute, provide the following details:

   - **Column Name**: Name for the attribute's column.
   - **Data Type**: Choose the appropriate data type.
   - **Description**: Provide a description for the attribute.
   - **Unique**: Check the "Unique" checkbox to mark the attribute's data as unique.
   - **Indexable**: Check the "Indexable" checkbox to mark the attribute's data as indexable.
   - **Searchable**: Check the "Searchable" checkbox to mark the attribute's data as searchable.
   - **Sortable**: Check the "Sortable" checkbox to mark the attribute's data as sortable.
   - **Editable**: Check the "Editable" checkbox to use the attribute's data as an identifier for updating data.
   - **Deletable**: Check the "Deletable" checkbox to use the attribute's data as an identifier for deleting data.

7. **Save**: Click on the save icon to add new attributes. You can add as many attributes as needed for your table.
