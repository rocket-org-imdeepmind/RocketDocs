## How to Use Rocket

Building backend systems using Rocket is incredibly simple and intuitive. Here's an overview of how to use Rocket:

1. **Creating Databases**: Users can create databases within Rocket to organize their data effectively. Each database acts as a container for tables and data.

2. **Defining Tables**: Once a database is created, users can define tables within the database to structure their data. Tables consist of attributes, where each represents a specific field.

3. **Attribute Definition**: Users can specify supported properties and operations for each attribute.

4. **Endpoint Definition**: Based on the defined tables and attributes, Rocket automatically creates API endpoints. It also generates basic documentation for each APIs.

5. **Adding, Editing, and Deleting Data**: Users can manage data within their tables by adding, editing, or deleting records. Rocket provides intuitive interfaces for performing these operations. Users can also generate fake data using Rocket's synthetic data generator.

6. **Accessing APIs**: Once APIs are created, they can be accessed by external applications or services. Users can integrate these APIs into their projects to retrieve or manipulate data stored within Rocket. Rocket provides support for Swagger, Redoc, and OpenAPI for the API, allowing users to interact with the APIs.

7. **Webhook Integration**: Rocket supports webhook integration, allowing users to connect external services and automate processes based on events within Rocket.
