# Creating Database

Databases in Rocket are equivalent to projects. To begin building your API, start by creating a database. Follow these steps to create a database with essential details:

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**: Log in to your Rocket account and access the dashboard.

2. **Click "New Database"**: On the dashboard, you'll find an option to create a new database. Click on it to get started.

3. **Database Details**:

   - **Database Name**: Provide a descriptive name for your database. This name will help you identify and manage your project easily.

   - **Description**: Add a brief description of your database to provide context and information to your team members or collaborators.

   - **Version**: Specify the version of your database. This can be useful for tracking changes and updates to your project over time.

   - **Tags**: You can add tags to categorize your database. Tags help in organizing for your projects later.

4. **Create Database**: Once you've filled in the essential details, click the "Create Database" button to create your database.

5. **Access Your New Database**: Your newly created database will now appear on your dashboard. You can select the new database by clicking on the top right database selector.
