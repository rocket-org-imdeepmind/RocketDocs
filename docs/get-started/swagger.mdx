To gain a deeper understanding of the purpose and functionality of your APIs, Rocket provides seamless integration with Swagger. Additionally, Rocket offers OpenAPI documentation for your APIs, enabling smooth integration with various other platforms. Here's how you can access and utilize Swagger:

## Accessing Swagger

1. **Go to the APIs Page**: Log in to your Rocket account and navigate to the dashboard.

2. **Navigate to the APIs Page**: In the left navigation menu, click on "APIs" to enter the API documentation section.

3. **Open Swagger**: On the top right corner of the APIs page, you'll find a green "Open Swagger" button. Click on it to access the Swagger interface.

## Exploring Your APIs with Swagger

Once you've opened Swagger, you can interact with your APIs to gain a deeper understanding of their purpose and functionality:

1. **API Endpoints**: Swagger provides a user-friendly interface where you can view all your API endpoints organized by table.

2. **Interactive Documentation**: Click on any API endpoint to view detailed interactive documentation. This documentation includes information on request parameters, response structures, and example requests and responses.

3. **Test Endpoints**: Swagger allows you to test API endpoints directly within the interface. You can send requests, provide input data, and see the responses in real-time.

4. **Authorization**: If your APIs require authentication, Swagger provides a way to input authentication tokens or credentials for testing.

5. **Export OpenAPI Documentation**: Rocket also offers OpenAPI documentation for your APIs. You can export this documentation to integrate your APIs seamlessly with other platforms or share it with collaborators.
