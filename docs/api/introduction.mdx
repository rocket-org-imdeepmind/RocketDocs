# Introduction

Now that you have defined the table structure, operations, and added data, Rocket automatically generates APIs for your database. Rocket generates these APIs based on the following parameters:

- Attributes & Tables
- RocketQuery
- RocketAuth

In Rocket, there are three types of APIs:

- Attribute APIs: APIs that are created based on Attributes & Tables.
- Query APIs: APIs that are created by RocketQuery.
- Auth APIs: APIs that are created by RocketAuth.

Rocket generates basic documentation for these APIs, derived from the details provided during database, table, and attribute creation, as well as other information.

While Rocket generates basic documentation, it is essential to review and enhance the documentation on the APIs page to improve comprehension and foster better collaboration.
