# Documenting APIs

Rocket generates basic documentation for APIs. However, you can change the documentation based on your needs. To update the documentation, follow the steps below.

<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DJxFNpzM58?start=262"
    title="YouTube video 
      player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; 
      encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

1. **Navigate to Your Database**: Log in to your Rocket account and select the desired database from the database selector located at the top left corner of the interface.

2. **Access API Page**: On the left navigation menu, click on the "API" link to access the Data page.

3. **Select Desired API to Edit**: From the list of APIs, select the API you want to update. Then click on the edit button present on the left side of the table.

4. **Edit API**: You will be directed to the Edit API page, where you'll find the title and description fields. Edit these fields as needed.

5. **Click on Submit**: After editing all the necessary data fields, click on the "Update" button to save the documentation.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly update API documentation.
