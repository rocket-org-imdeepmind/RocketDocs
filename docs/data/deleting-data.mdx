# Deleting Data

If you need to remove data, you can do so directly from the user interface (UI) by following these steps:

    title="YouTube video 
      player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; 
      encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

1. **Navigate to Your Database**: Log in to your Rocket account and select the desired database from the database selector located at the top left corner of the interface.

2. **Access Data Page**: In the left navigation menu, click on the "Data" link to access the Data page.

3. **Select Desired Table**: Choose the table where you want to delete data from the list of tables. Click on the respective table to open it.

4. **Choose Data to Delete**: Identify the specific row in the data table that you want to delete, then click on the delete button located on the left side of the table.

5. **Confirmation Prompt**: Upon clicking the "Delete Data" button, a confirmation window will appear to ensure the action is intentional. Review the details and understand the consequences of deletion.

6. **Confirm Deletion**: If you are certain about deleting the data, confirm your decision by clicking on the "Delete" or "Confirm" button within the confirmation prompt.
