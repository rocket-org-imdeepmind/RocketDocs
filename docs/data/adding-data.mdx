# Adding Data

After defining your table, you can begin populating it with data. Simply follow the structure of the table and add data that matches that structure. Here's how you can add new data to your table:

<div class="videowrapper">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJKFv-jdBc4?rel=0"
    title="YouTube video 
      player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; 
      encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
