# Introduction

Once you have created a database and its associated tables, you can start adding data to the tables. There are two ways to add data in Rocket:

- The first way is by using Rocket's UI.
- The second way is to use the APIs that Rocket created.

> In this part of the documentation, we only focus on the first way, that is using the Rocket's UI.

</div>

## Data Operations

- **Adding Data**: For detailed instructions on adding data, refer to the documentation on [Adding Data](/data/adding-data).
- **Editing Data**: Learn about modifying and editing data by consulting the [Editing Data](/data/editing-data) documentation.
- **Deleting Data**: Remove data from your Rocket account by following the instructions outlined in [Deleting Data](/data/deleting-data).

## Field Rules

Field validation rules for adding data depend on the specified Data Types. Refer to the "Data Types Supported by Attributes" section [here](/table/understanding-attributes) for a list of supported data types and their specifications.
