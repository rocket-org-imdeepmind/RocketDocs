Now that you've defined the table structure, operations, and added data, Rocket automatically generates APIs for your database. While Rocket generates basic documentation, it's essential to review and enhance the documentation on the APIs page to improve comprehension and foster better collaboration.

## Accessing the APIs Page

To access the API documentation for your Rocket project, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Your Rocket Account**: Navigate to the Rocket dashboard and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the APIs Page**: In the left navigation menu, click on "APIs" to enter the API documentation section.

## Exploring APIs

APIs in Rocket are organized based on the tables you've created. Follow these steps to explore the APIs for a specific table:

1. **Select the Table**: From the list of tables displayed on the APIs page, click on the table you're interested in. This will take you to the APIs for that particular table.

2. **Review API Endpoints**: On the table-specific API page, you'll find a list of API endpoints that have been automatically generated based on your table structure and operations.

3. **API Documentation**: Review the documentation for each API endpoint. This documentation provides basic information on the API.

## Enhancing API Documentation

While Rocket generates basic API documentation, you can enhance it to provide additional context, examples, and usage guidelines. Here are some tips for improving API documentation:

- **Summary**: Provide a clear title for the API.

- **Descriptions**: Add clear and concise descriptions for each API endpoint, explaining its purpose and how it fits into your project.

## Collaborative Development

Enhancing the API documentation not only benefits you but also facilitates better collaboration among your team members and external developers who may be working with your Rocket project. Clear and well-documented APIs make it easier for everyone to understand and utilize the capabilities of your project.
