Approximately a year ago, I was working on a project to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for my employer in the healthcare sector. This POC revolved around addressing [HEDIS measures](https://www.ncqa.org/hedis), presenting a simplified dashboard to visualize healthcare data. The POC was simple and for the POC, I developed a straightforward authentication system and a set of APIs to support the dashboard's functionality.

While I was working on this project, the concept of Rocket began to take shape in my mind. For a variety of projects and POCs, I create a lot of APIs that to some extent do the same thing. Sometimes for these projects, I even copy code from my old project to new project just to some save time. Imagine a platform capable of effortlessly generating APIs for similar projects without the need for manual coding. All that would be required is to define the data structure and necessary operations, and Rocket would handle the rest automatically.

Initially, my vision for Rocket was modest: to create an alternative to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), offering dynamic JSON data through simple [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) APIs. However, as development progressed, Rocket rapidly evolved beyond these initial aspirations. It transformed into a comprehensive no-code platform, empowering users to construct sophisticated backend systems tailored to a diverse array of use cases.

## Identifying the Challenge

Before delving into Rocket's capabilities, it's crucial to grasp the problem it aims to solve.

In today's landscape, merely conceptualizing an idea is insufficient. Transforming that idea into a functional Proof of Concept (POC) holds enormous importance. POCs serve not only to validate initial concepts but also to demonstrate viability of the idea to potential users, investors, and other stakeholders. Refer to [this article](https://lucidspark.com/blog/proof-of-concept) for insights into the significance of POCs, MVPs, and prototypes in product development and market research.

However, developing such POCs present a significant challenge. The iterative nature of POC development, characterized by frequent incremental changes, can render the development process cumbersome. Moreover, for many POCs, the primary backend functionality revolves around basic data operations such as searching, fetching, and inserting.

### Leveraging No-Code in Prototyping

Utilizing No-Code or Low-Code platforms for developing functional prototypes or MVPs or POCs can significantly improve the development timelines. These platforms offer a ray of hope for swiftly experimenting with ideas and features, bypassing the potential weeks or months typically required for traditional development. Moreover, incremental changes are extremely simple to implement and test.

## Say Hello to Rocket

Rocket is a No-Code platform that make building complex backend applications absolutely easy. Rocket provide a multitude of features to build complex backends simple and efficient. Starting from a powerful authentication system to generating APIs automatically to documenting APIs, Rocket can do most of the things a powerful backend system need.

> Rocket currently is a No-Code platform, however with introduction on RocketFunctions, Rocket will be more like a Low-Code platform. Check the [roadmap](https://rocket-roadmap.notion.site/d42fc3f1823f426bbe3f62cafbdb5189?v=6e9bd7ad1d0d40d3a795a0b41f0d0ec0) for more information on RocketFunctions.

Let's dive deeper into some of the features of Rocket.

### Swift and Simple API Creation

At the heart of Rocket's innovation is the remarkable speed and simplicity it brings to backend systems. Picture this: You no longer need to be a coding ninja to develop robust backend APIs. With Rocket, the process is transformed into a straightforward, intuitive experience.

In Rocket, you just need to tell the structure of the data that you need to store by defining tables (tables in Rocket is similar to tables in SQL database), and the particular operations needed on the data. Rocket will automatically create the needed APIs for the backend system.

For example, you if you name column inside a particular table as searchable, Rocket will automatically create API to search names.

### Flexibility and Adaptability

The dynamic nature of prototypes demands flexibility. Any POCs or MVPs go through hundreds of iteration. All these iteration requires constant incremental changes. This is where Rocket shines brightest.

Rocket's no-code platform make these incremental changes simple and easy to make. Just with few clicks any features can be added/updated. There is no need to worry about breaking changes and testing the entire backend system after every new change.

### Authentication System

Most modern application need a powerful authentication and authorization system. Ability to identity user and provide content based on the user is something that is expected from variety of applications.

Rocket provides a powerful authentication system similar to [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) that can be used to create complete authentication system. Rocket will automatically create the needed APIs for the authentication system. Moreover, Rocket also provides a simple dashboard to manage all the users.

### API Documentation

Creating API is just one part of the equation, to facilitate better collaboration between multiple teams, documenting the APIs is also equally important. Rocket provide first class support for OpenAPI documentation for the APIs. WIth the power of OpenAPI, Rocket automatically generate Swagger, Redoc, and Scaler documentation.

### Effortless Integration

Sometimes some complex backend applications come with some business logic that cannot be implemented with a no-code platform like Rocket. For example, if you're building a backend service that uses a ML model, then of course, Rocket cannot create the model for you.

This is where third-party integration comes into play. Rocket doesn't operate in isolation. It's designed to seamlessly integrate with various backend services. Rocket provide s both APIs and webhooks for third-party integration.

In your ML based service, the ML model can be used easily with Rocket. So in other terms Rocket can be used to build create all the boring APIs needed to your backend service, so you can focus on building fun part, that is the ML model.
